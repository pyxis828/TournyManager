# TournyManager
This is a program which will allow the user to run a home poker tournamnet.  It will allow the user to enter their own blind 
structures or use a predefined structure.  Structure to consist of small blind, big blind and level time.  May also (optionally)
have antes and list the current game being played (useful for mixed games where the game changes each level).  Additional features to be added at later iterations.
